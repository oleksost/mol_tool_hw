## Usage
See [demo.ipynb](https://github.com/oleksost/mol_tool_hw/blob/main/demo.ipynb) for a demo.

## Functionality:

### Part 1: Custom Retriever Tool Development

Retriever tool in LangChain that can access and parse the content of the specified paper. The tool can handle different types of queries related to the paper's content, such as summarization, specific data.

### Part 2: Predictive Machine Learning Model Tooling Implementation

Train a regression model to predict hydration free energy for SMILE molecules usingf FreeSolvdataset. Deploys this model into a custom LangChain tool.
